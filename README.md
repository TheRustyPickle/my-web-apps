# What is this?

This repository contains a collection of web applications I developed using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Currently, web apps are not hosted anywhere.

## Getting Started

To run the web apps locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheRustyPickle/my-web-apps
    cd my-web-apps
    ```
2. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the application in development mode.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the web apps.

## Web Apps

**1. Media Scraper**: The web scraper is built with Puppeteer and is designed to extract downloadable content such as images, videos, audio, PDFs, etc., from a web page.

**2. Repo D/L**: This is designed to show the total downloads of releases and their assets in a GitHub repository. It uses Octokit to fetch data in the background.
